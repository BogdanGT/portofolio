# Portofolio - www.bogdangt.com

[WEBSITE](https://www.bogdangt.com)

This is my portfolio website, where I showcase everything that defines me as a developer — from the projects I’ve built and the technologies I use, to my personal approach and working style. The purpose of this site is to provide a clear and authentic picture of my technical skills, my passion for development, and the way I tackle every programming challenge.
